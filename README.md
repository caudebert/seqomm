### What is this?



* Codes *[1]*

  * ./omm: OMM stands for Observable Moment Matching. This method estimates the PDF of hidden parameters from the statistical moments of dome observable quantities. Try our demo test case and learn more about it by reading ./omm/README.md. 
  * ./time_step_selection: OMM on its own might become computationally challenging when confronted to high-dimensional observables. You will find in this directory a program that selects a subset of the available time steps of your signal to be fed to OMM. Read ./time_step_selection/README.md further instructions.

* Data *[2]*

  * ./data/demo
